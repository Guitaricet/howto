# Howto
Howto is a GPT-3/Codex-powered shell tool that allows you to talk with your shell in natural language.


[![Howto demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2821124/197363019-b038d31e-fde0-45a5-b347-3e87e0c260a6.gif)](https://youtu.be/VwP9eZdTrGY)

Forgot how to create a conda environment?
```bash
% howto create conda env
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.6
```

Forgot how to add a new env to Jupyter?
```bash
% howto add kernel to jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=
```

Want to download the biggest Rick Astley's hit?
```bash
% howto download youtube video for never give you up
youtube-dl -f 18 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

Howto can also suggest how to be a nicer person
```bash
 % howto be a nicer person
alias please='sudo'
```

It works by sending requests to [OpenAI API](http://openai.com/api/). Lookup [Environment Variables](https://github.com/Guitaricet/howto#environment-variables) section on how to set up the API key.

# Installation

## Two-liner

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Guitaricet/howto/main/scripts/get_latest.sh)"
sudo mv howto /usr/local/bin/  # howto.exe on windows
```

When first calling `howto` it will ask you to set up the API key. Get your OpenAI API key [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart/add-your-api-key).

> If you get `org.freedesktop.secrets` error, install Gnome-keyring `sudo apt-get install gnome-keyring`. It is needed for secure API key storage.
